### Hello world!

You seem to have found your way to the GitHub profile of Stefan LÃ¶rwald ðŸ˜‰

This profile is my private one. All actions I do with it are not associated with my current employer in any way, i.e. they are done outside of the context of work with them and therefore also do not reflect their views, but only my own.

If you want to get in touch, please do so via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-l%C3%B6rwald/), if it is in relation to work. I do not give support via LinkedIn or email: if you find an issue with any project that I've been / am involved in, please raise an issue with the corresponding repository.
